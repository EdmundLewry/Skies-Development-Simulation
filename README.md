# Skies Development Simulation

In this repository you'll find a relatively simple project intended to simulate the development of software projects by teams of developers. It consists of a core domain and several applications which make use of it.

As a minimum, it should be able to output:
- End Date of all project work
- Given a date, return story points complete
- Given a date, return features complete

I use this project as a testing ground to explore various tools, technologies, and software development approaches. It is a relatively simple implementation, but with the capacity to have complexities, multiple modules, logic to test, a domain to apply architectural approaches to and so on.

## A Short Description of the Domain
A **TEAM** of **DEVELOPERS** take on a **PROJECT** which consists of **TASKS** in order to create **FEATURES**. Each task has **REQUIREMENTS** which make it more efficient to complete if the developer has **PROFICIENCY** in the required **SKILL**.
